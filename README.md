# Red Wine Analysis
This was a group project from our Comp 442 class at CSUN. Our goal is to demonstate Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10.
